# RustWorks

An operating system and bootloader for the Numworks calculator (model n0110).

## Setup

First follow the instructions in [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) then clone the
repository **recursively**:

```zsh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nw-rs/rustworks.git
```

Currently the bootloader and external flash drivers are not finished so
everything must be flashed individually, please read the readme of the
submodule you are interested in for more information on flashing or
using it.
